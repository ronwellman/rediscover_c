# Pass by value vs Pass by reference
* [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_function_call_by_reference.htm)
* [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation)

Often times you'll need to pass the address of something rather than the thing itself
* more memory efficient
* you want to update the thing in the function
* you may not know how many elements an array has during compilation
