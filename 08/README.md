## Pointers
hold a memory address of where a value is stored rather than the value itself

### Common Operators
* * - dereference
* & - address of

### Pass by value vs Pass by reference
* [washington.edu](https://courses.washington.edu/css342/zander/css332/passby.html)
* [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation)

Often times you'll need to pass the address of something rather than the thing itself
* more memory efficient
* you want to update the thing in the function
* you may not know how many elements an array has during compilation
